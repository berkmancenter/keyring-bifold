/**
 * The real `@openvtc/trust-tasks` runtime, loaded into this CommonJS service.
 *
 * The package is ESM-only with an `import`-condition-only exports map, so
 * `require()` cannot load it even on Node 20.19's require(esm) (the
 * condition set has no `default`/`require` entry) — dynamic `import()` is the
 * one legal bridge. TypeScript with `module: commonjs` rewrites a literal
 * `import()` into `require()`, so the call goes through `Function` to reach
 * Node's native dynamic import untouched. Types resolve through the tsconfig
 * `paths` map onto the package's .d.ts files. Loaded once, cached.
 *
 * Why this replaced the local ./framework.ts pipeline: one §7.2
 * implementation for wallet and witness (the wallet consumes through the
 * same runtime), so conformance cannot drift between the two sides.
