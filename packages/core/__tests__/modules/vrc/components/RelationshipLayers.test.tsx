 * "How you know <name>", one entry per day, read through the real locale files and the app's default escaping: three

 * day joins it; a day opens a sheet with the witness's record and each exchange; and a name reads as given, never
 * HTML-escaped. Before, each set of cards was its own line, the same words and
 * date two or three times, and the witness record sat in another block in another date format.
