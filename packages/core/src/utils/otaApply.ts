/**
 * Hooks for applying a downloaded over-the-air update when the person comes back.
 *
 * The app (the wallet's withOta) may reload into a staged update at one moment
 * only: when it returns from the background and bifold has just locked the person
 * out for inactivity (activity.tsx). They land on the PIN screen anyway, so the
 * reload interrupts nothing they see. Bifold reports that moment here, with how
 * long the app was away; the app decides.
 *
 * Anything a reload would lose registers a blocker while it lasts: a request to the
 * VTA waiting on its reply, a sign-in between claim and answer, an unsent chat
 * draft. While any is open, the app doesn't apply. It looks again at the next
 * return (nothing is deferred), and a cold start applies as it always has.
 * A relationship exchange needs no blocker: an interrupted one is resumed after a
 * restart (resumeInterruptedExchanges in trust-tasks/ceremony.ts).
