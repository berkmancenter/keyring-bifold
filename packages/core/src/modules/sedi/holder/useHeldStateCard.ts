/**
 * The state card Credentials shows, if any (SEDI/KERI holder card): the Guardian card this phone holds (the Developer
 * action "Hold the test Guardian card (K0)" puts it there), checked on this phone.
 *
 * The held record is read each time Credentials comes into focus (one record query), so a card held from Developer
 * settings is there on return. The chain check is not: it runs once per mount for a given card and inputs
 * (checkKeyOf), never on a render or a focus that changed neither, so drawing the Wallet stays cheap.
 *
 * The check can fetch the state's published record over the network (checkGuardianEvidenceResolving), so it runs in an
 * effect, and until it answers the card says it is checking (never "Checks out"). An answer that comes back after the
 * card left the screen, after "State card (demo)" was turned off, or for inputs that have since changed is dropped.
 * When the card can't be checked at all (state-verified approvers off, no root trusted), that is known at once and
 * nothing runs.
 *
 * Nothing at all with "State card (demo)" off, its remote off or the SEDI/KERI one included, read at each render.
 *
