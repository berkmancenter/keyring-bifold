 * - `unsupportedCesr`: Keyring can't verify this. It uses a code or a KERI feature (a delegated event, a weighted
 *   threshold, witnesses, a digest code other than E/I) that this package does not verify yet.
 * - `malformedCesr`: this can't be read. It does not add up as CESR (cut short, counts wrong, trailing bytes, empty).
 * - `kelNotReplaying`: the stream reads, but the KEL it carries does not verify (a SAID, prior, pre-rotation or
 *   controller signature fails, or it is duplicitous). The material may have been constructed or edited, so the
 *   whole presentation is refused, even when that KEL is not on the chain being checked. It carries the prefix the
