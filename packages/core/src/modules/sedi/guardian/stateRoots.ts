/**
 * The State roots this phone trusts for a Guardian card (trusted-approver plan, stage 2, S1), each with the name Who
 * approves shows. A card is shown as from a state only when its chain ends at one of these, and the name shown is
 * ours, never the sender's.
 *
 * A release trusts none: empty, so nothing verifies and every card reads "Couldn't verify the state card", unless the
 * Developer setting "Trust the test state (K0)" is on (trustTestStateFlag.ts, which holds only while trusted approvers
 * and state-verified approvers are both on). A Developer build (`__DEV__`) trusts the K0 test root without it. Either
 * way it is the K0 test root only, the keripy kit the tests check against (sedi/__tests__/fixtures/k0-utah-v2). It is
 * named "State of Utah" and marked `demo`, so Who approves shows a "Demo" pill beside the name, never a pill inferred
 * from the name. The kit is SEDI's Utah test material (k0-utah-v2), not anything Utah issued: the Demo pill and the
 * holder card's "not issued by the State of Utah" say so. Real State roots come from did:webs (IN-619), not from this
 * list, and are never marked demo.
