/**
 * The real rooms service, R1: what a member reads. The phone talks only to its own agent and to its
 * communities, over the legs it already has (wallet docs/plans/openvtc-rooms-plan/2026-10-25-al.md):
 *
 * - **My rooms** is the community's record (`vtc/rooms/memberships/list`, sent as the persona the phone
 *   joined with) joined with the agent's key custody (`rooms/keys/list`). A room the agent holds keys for
 *   but no community lists is `source: 'custody'`.
 * - **Notes**: the agent lists and opens them (`rooms/keys/browse`, `rooms/keys/read`). The agent makes the
 *   host call itself, and the host comes from the membership. The phone never talks to a host and never
 *   holds a room key.
 *
 * - **Offers** are the community's (`vtc/rooms/offers/list`, sent as the persona). Accepting stores the offer's
 *   credentials in the agent's vault and, on a sealed room, has the agent mint the KeyPackage and join from the
 *   Welcome the community answers with. The phone never holds a room key or a KeyPackage's private half.
 *   Renewals the listing carries are stored in place of the credentials they renew; they are never accepted.
 *
 * - **Writes and curation** are requests to the room's host, completed as the member by the agent
 *   (`rooms/keys/act`), which inserts the member's presentation and signs; the phone sends the completed document
 *   to the host unchanged, over the same DIDComm session it reaches the community on. The phone adds nothing to it
 *   and holds no key that could. Writing is built for `open` rooms; a sealed room's record is sealed by the agent
 *   first, which is a later phase.
 *
 * Files and agent access are later phases and report `clientNotBuilt`.
