/**
 * When the person's agent last held a rooms task for consent, kept across launches, so the phone does not ask it again
 * for a day.
 *
 * A task an agent's policy holds is refused at once here (`waitForConsent: false`), but the agent has already sent its
 * consent requests by then: to this phone, or to a trusted approver's, where a request stays pending for 15 minutes
 * (vta-service `policy_gate.rs`, docs/02-vta/task-consent.md) and nothing on this side can withdraw it. A rooms task the
 * phone sends on its own (a page's batch read, a room's watch) would raise one on every launch, and through every
 * session after the last one stopped. So a hold is noted here, by agent and task type, and the task is not sent to that
 * agent again until {@link CONSENT_HOLD_BACKOFF_MS} has passed. What it would have done is done the old way meanwhile.
 *
 * - **By agent**, which is the policy's scope: every identity this phone holds on one agent is held by the same rules,
 *   so a hold met while asking as one identity stops the task for all of them. The agent is the phone's own VTA, the
 *   one it is linked to, whichever identity a shared session is signed in as.
 * - **Compared at use.** A batch or a watch about to go out asks {@link ConsentHolds.heldRecently} with the time it is
 *   now, against the time the hold was noted. There is no timer and none is wanted: a timer would not survive a
 *   relaunch, and what it would do is already the comparison.
 * - **Fails toward holding.** A row that can't be read or parsed, or no agent to key it by, reads as held: the task is
 *   an optimisation, and an approval request on someone else's phone is not its to raise.
