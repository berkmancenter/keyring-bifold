/**
 * What a writer may put in a room's record, and what it writes: a record's `kind`, what it answers, and when it was
 * written and edited (`SealedRecordBody`, rooms/_shared 0.2; trust-tasks-tf #1027).
 *
 * The rule is the writer's, and nobody else applies it: `rooms/keys/seal/0.3` does not check the room's profile, and no
 * host can on a sealed tier. "A writer MUST NOT write `kind`, `inReplyTo`, `writtenAt`, `editedAt`, `width`, `height` or
 * `preview` into a room unless the room's current profile" lists that member; no profile, one that doesn't list it, or
 * one that can't be read permits none.
 *
 * **Sending isn't switched on.** `RoomsBackend.recordSending` is set by nothing but tests, and signing new content
 * needs a maintainer's word on the finished change before it is.
 *
