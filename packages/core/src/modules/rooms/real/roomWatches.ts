/**
 * Watches on rooms, so a room in view learns of a change from the person's own agent instead of asking every 10
 * seconds (`rooms/keys/watch/0.1` and `rooms/keys/changed/0.1`; rooms-slow-1105.md §8 phase A′).
 *
 * After a room is read, it is armed (or armed again) at its host, as its member, from the version read
 * (`sinceVersion`): the host signals once the room moves past it, the agent passes that signal on, and the room is
 * read once. **One arming is one signal**: the agent forgets a watch before it passes the signal on (vta-service
 * `room_key_watch.rs`), so a room is armed again after each read that moved it.
 *
 * - **Serial, and grouped.** The agent arms a request's rooms one after another, and the agent client sends one task
 *   at a time, so every room wanted at one host as one member goes in one request (up to {@link WATCH_ROOMS_MAX}), and
 *   requests go one after another.
 * - **Polling stays, as the fallback.** A room is watched only while its watch is armed. An agent that does not serve
 *   the task, a host that refuses it (VTC < 0.24 answers `hostRefused`), a room refused on its own (`notAMember`,
 *   `limitReached`, …) or a request that gets no answer leaves the room polled as before.
 * - **A hold is kept for a day.** The task is declared `Mutating`, and a rule set elsewhere on that class holds it,
 *   after the agent has sent its approvers a request (consentHolds.ts). It goes with `waitForConsent: false`, a hold
 *   is noted, and no watch goes to that agent until a day has passed. A refusal of the task itself
 *   (`unsupportedType`) stops watches for this session.
 * - **A signal is trusted only as far as a read.** It is acted on only when it names a room armed here, as the member
 *   and at the host it was armed with, and then only by reading that room once.
