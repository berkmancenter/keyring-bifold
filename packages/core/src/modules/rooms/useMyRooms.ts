/**
 * The member's rooms and room offers, as the entry points show them: read from the rooms service once
 * per screen, narrowed to one community when asked. An operation the service says is not available is
 * not called: its status is kept, so the screen shows why instead of an empty list. When a screen reads
 * again is useRereadOnReturn's: this says how the last read went and what the offers poll knows beyond it.
 *
 * The rooms show as soon as they are listed, and the last listing at once when the screen opens again; the offers are
 * read beside them and never hold them back or fail them. A community that left its offers unanswered for minutes
 * (First VTC, a tester's 277.4 log, 11-02) held the whole list for each 30 s wait, and on the community's own screen
 * failed it as "Couldn't reach your agent", whose Try again waited on the same unanswered ask. A read that fails is
 * tried once more after {@link MY_ROOMS_RETRY_MS} while the screen is open, and every failure and retry is logged.
