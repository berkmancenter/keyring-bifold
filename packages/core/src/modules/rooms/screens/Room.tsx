/**
 * A room as a conversation (rooms member sprint, RoomView), read as the person-to-person chat reads: newest at the
 * bottom, where it opens, a day pill above each day's posts, and "Load older" at the top. Nothing pushes a post to a
 * phone, so while the room is in view and the app in the foreground, new posts are asked for every few seconds
 * (`useRoomPosts`); one arrives at the bottom, in view only if the member is there already. Sending goes to the
 * bottom, as the person-to-person chat does. Pull to refresh is offered while there are no posts to show; with posts,
 * a poll that fails says "Couldn't refresh · Try again" at the bottom until one succeeds. Above the posts,
 * the room's name and tier and who the member posts as; and a warning when the member's agent found the host's
 * answer inconsistent (records dropped or replayed).
 *
 * A post's words are its chat message, or the record as it was written: inert either way, never followed. Below the
 * posts, the composer: a post shows at once as sending, and stays, marked, if it could not be sent. Where the member
 * may not post, the composer gives the reason instead. A post's files show as chips; a tap opens the attachment sheet
 * (download, then share), and "+" posts one.
 *
 * A long press on a post offers Copy. Where sending is on and the room takes them (useRecordSending), it also offers a
 * reaction, a reply, and on the member's own message an edit or a withdrawal; where sending is on and the room takes
 * neither, the sheet says they aren't on in this room yet. A reaction or a change shows once the room has stored it.
 *
 * The screen is the chat alone (rooms in Messages, R2, chat B). The header opens the room's details (RoomInfo), and
 * from there its files, its notes (titled records and the markers of removed ones, which the chat leaves out) and its
 * members, each a screen of its own. The files' "Add a file" comes back here with `attach`, and the composer's "+"
 * opens. Reached only while the rooms flag is on.
 *
