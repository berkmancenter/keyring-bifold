/**
 * A room's posts as RoomView shows them: newest first, {@link POSTS_PAGE} at a time, "load older" for the next
 * page, and a refresh (pull down) that lists the room again. Nothing pushes a post to a phone, so while the room is
 * `live` (in view, the app in the foreground) it asks every {@link ROOM_POLL_MS} for the records above the newest
 * version it holds, and catches up at once on coming back. Upstream's browse says a consumer SHOULD NOT poll; the
 * poll is kept to the room the member is looking at.
 *
 * Until the rooms service pages from the newest itself, this lists the room once and reads each shown record. A read
 * is kept by key and version, so a new listing reads only what is new or changed: a refresh or a poll that finds
 * nothing new reads nothing and redraws nothing. A record that can't be read stays in its place as "couldn't be
 * read", never hiding the rest, and is read again with the next listing.
 *
 * The agent client sends one task at a time, so a poll is skipped while a listing of the room is still being asked:
 * it never queues behind itself, and a member's own post waits behind one listing at most.
