# Vendored rooms schemas

Copied verbatim from the Trust Tasks specification registry, keeping the
registry's own layout under `specs/` so every relative `$ref` resolves the
way it does upstream. `../roomsDataPath.test.ts` checks the requests the real
rooms service sends, and the answers its fake agent gives, against these
schemas. That way the fake cannot quietly accept or give a shape the agent
never would; the `acl-schemas` README next door describes how that once
happened.

These are knowingly **ahead of the shared pin** (`scripts/openvtc/PINS.json`).
`rooms/keys/seal/0.3` and the record members of `SealedRecordBody`
(trust-tasks-tf #1027) postdate the pin, and Keyring sends them.
