/**
 * A member's polls: read them, take a ticket, vote, and see the vote through to a kept receipt, however the app is
 * interrupted on the way.
 *
 * **One record per poll on this phone**, across every agent linked to it (`PollRecord`), written before anything is
 * asked of anyone. It says which identity and which agent took the ticket and when the member voted, and while a
 * vote is on its way it holds the built cast, then the receipt, and nothing else. It lives in the wallet's encrypted
 * store, which is out of device backups (Android `allowBackup="false"`; iOS excludes the store's folder), and nothing
 * here logs what it holds.
 *
 * **One vote per membership, kept on this phone only.** A second ticket is refused once a vote is recorded, or while
 * another agent still linked to this phone holds one. Upstream counts memberships, not people, so this is a courtesy:
 * two agents on two phones share nothing this can see.
 *
 * **The cast is a persisted state machine** — built, sent, receipt kept — because the agent builds a fresh cast on
 * every `vta/pcs/vote` (new randomness, a new one-time key) while the ticket fixes its tag. The only safe retry after
 * a kill, a background or a lost answer is the same bytes again, which the ballot box answers with the first receipt.
 * So the cast is stored before it is sent, from build to receipt, and dropped once the receipt is kept; the receipt is
 * held only until the agent keeps it. After that the record says when the member voted and nothing that proves how:
 * on an open poll the cast and its receipt would be that proof. A crash before the cast was stored builds a new one:
 * nothing went out. A crash between the record and the ticket is safe: the agent answers a second register from its
 * record (`ticketHeld`), and the community answers a resent ticket request from its own.
 *
 * **The pause before a cast** (`sendAfter`, up to `MAX_CAST_DELAY_MS`) blurs the order in which casts sent close
 * together arrive. It does not stop a community and a ballot box that compare notes from pairing a ticket's issue
 * time with a vote's arrival when few members vote in that window, and it does not hide the phone's IP address from
 * the ballot box.
 *
