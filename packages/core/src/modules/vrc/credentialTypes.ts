/**
 * Canonical credential type detection for the VRC module.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for "what kind of credential is this?".
 * Screens, hooks, utils, and the display registry must import these predicates
 * instead of re-implementing type-string matching inline — adding a new
 * credential kind (or an RCE v4 shape) then means touching exactly one file.
 *
 * Inputs are deliberately tolerant: a predicate accepts a credential JSON
 * object (its `type` property is read), an array of type strings, or a single
 * type string (some AnonCreds call sites only hold a serialized type value).
 * Matching is substring-based per element, mirroring the long-standing
 * behavior of the display registry's original helpers.
 *
 * VSC migration (docs/plans/vsc-migration-plan.md §1, §6 V3): WD 0.4.0
 * collapses `WitnessCredential`/`EndorsementCredential` into one
 * `StatementCredential` type whose meaning lives in `credentialSubject.predicate`,
 * not the type array. "Is this a witness credential?" therefore stops being
 * answerable from a type array alone — it needs the full credential JSON, so
 * `credentialSubject.predicate` can be checked against `@bifold/dtg-vocab`'s
 * accept-list. `isWitnessCredential`/`isPeerVrcCredential` below read both
 * shapes (dual-read, plan §7 — deleted one release after V4 ships to the
 * last channel; TODO once that date is known).
 *
 * Known limitation: a predicate is only checked when the input is a full
 * credential-shaped object. Two call sites in `vrc-manager.ts` used to pass a
 * bare `type` array where a full credential was already in scope — fixed to
 * pass the credential object instead (AL's review, finding A14), so as of
 * this migration there are no known call sites still passing a bare type
 * array where predicate-aware detection would matter. If one is added later,
 * it silently falls back to type-string-only detection — document it here.
