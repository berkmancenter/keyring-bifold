/**
 * "Confirm it's you" (confirmItsYouSpec.ts), both phones: Sam gets a call that sounds like Jordan asking for money,
 * so Sam's phone asks Jordan's, over the relationship they set up, "is this really you?" with a note. Jordan's phone
 * shows the note; Jordan answers "it's me" or "not me", and either answer needs Jordan's own phone lock (Face ID,
 * fingerprint or passcode). Sam's phone shows the answer, or that none came in time.
 *
 * What makes it evidence: the answer is signed under the relationship DID Jordan's phone holds, and verified under
 * the one the relationship established. A cloned voice cannot make that signature. Nothing is read unverified: with no
 * relationship on the connection, a document is dropped (and logged). An answer counts only against a request this
 * phone sent on that connection, on that thread, still open, carrying its challenge back.
 *
 * Person to person: no agent or VTA is involved, so it works between any two Keyring contacts.
 *
 * Off unless the "Confirm it's you" switch is on (confirmItsYouFlag.ts).
 *
 * Records are changed in place, never deleted (one per contact on each phone), so this goes out over the air.
