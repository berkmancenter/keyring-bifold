/**
 * "Check that your agent waits for them" on Who approves: whether the agent holds a task for consent at all.
 *
 * A trusted approver written on an agent that enforces no rules is never asked (Alberto's albertoleon-vta, 11-10:
 * rules written, the approver said yes, and the persona mint went through unheld). Upstream gives no read-only way to
 * see enforcement (VTI docs/02-vta/task-consent.md, "Turn the PDP on": no runtime surface), so this runs the same live
 * probe as "Send me a test request" ({@link vtaAgent.sendTestRequest}): it asks the agent to create a test context
 * that this phone's own "Ask me before…" rule holds. It has side effects (a held request in Requests, or a context
 * created and deleted again), which is why it runs only on a tap, never on open or focus.
 *
 * The probe's rule names this phone's own approver set (approvalRules.ts phoneSetName, withPhoneRule), and it is
 * offered only while no other rule names that task (ApprovalsView.canTest), so the request reaches this phone alone,
 * never a trusted approver: keyring-trusted-approvers rules never cover contexts/create (trustedApprovers.ts).
