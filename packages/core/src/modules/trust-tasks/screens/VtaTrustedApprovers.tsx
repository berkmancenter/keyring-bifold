 * "Who approves": the people who approve for this person on their agent (trusted-approver plan §4 step 3), and the
 * people this person approves for.
 *
 * A contact who said yes to an offer (approverRole.ts) waits here until the person adds them: adding writes the one
 * trusted set and its rules on the agent (`vtaAgent.setTrustedApprovers`, Face ID first). Removing one is the same
 * write without them; the agent may hold that for the approvers' yes, as it holds any rule change they cover.
 * Approvers are named from the relationships this phone asked over; one added some other way is said to be someone
 * not in the contacts.
 *
 * Reached from My agent only while the trusted-approvers switch is on, and guarded here too: navigation restore, a
 * later entry point, or the remote off (TRUSTED_APPROVERS_REMOTE_OFF) must not leave a working screen behind. Read again
 * on each focus, so a switch-off while it is open takes effect the next time it shows.
