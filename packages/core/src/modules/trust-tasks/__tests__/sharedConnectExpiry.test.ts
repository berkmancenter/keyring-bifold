/**
 * The confirm screen's "This code expires …" line. A link may run up to seven days, so a time alone on another day
 * reads as already past once that hour has gone by today, and the person may cancel a code that still works. The
 * words are ours and the clock is the phone's setting (utils/localDay.ts).
 *
 * What jest can't see: on a phone, the JS engine's toLocaleTimeString came out in English whatever the language.
 * Node's ICU localises it, so these rows pin the text to the app's own words, which stands in for that check
 * without observing it. Only a device or emulator frame observes it.
