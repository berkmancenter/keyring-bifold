/**
 * The Social Authorization (S2, trusted-approver plan stage 2): the guardian's phone, holding a Guardian card the
 * state issued to ITS OWN holder AID (sedi/holder/controller), issues the person it cares for (the card's own ward) an
 * authorization chained to that card, and sends it with the card (guardian-evidence/0.1's optional `social`). The
 * person's phone checks it (sedi/guardian verifySocialAuthorization) under the Guardian card's own live verdict, so a
 * card the state revokes takes the authorization with it.
 *
 * What it can honestly say: the authorization was signed by the key the state issued the card to, and it arrived over
 * this relationship, signed by the contact's relationship DID. So the card's holder is on the phone that sent it. It
 * says nothing more than that.
 *
 * Kept on the guardian's phone as one record, overwritten, never deleted: issued once per Guardian card, and only
 * issued again (the old one revoked in the same anchoring event) when the card changes. Behind trusted approvers and
 * state-verified approvers, as the card itself is.
