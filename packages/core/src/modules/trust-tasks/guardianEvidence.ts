/**
 * An approver's state Guardian card, carried to the phone of the person they approve for and checked there
 * (trusted-approver plan, stage 2, S1). Jordan says yes to approving for Sam; if Jordan's phone holds a Guardian card,
 * it sends the chain after the yes (approver/guardian-evidence/0.1, signed under its relationship DID). Sam's phone
 * checks it with sedi/guardian's verifyGuardian against the State roots this build trusts (sedi/guardian/stateRoots)
 * and the ward set on this phone, keeps the card and the verdict on the offer's record, and checks it again each
 * time Who approves opens (a card can expire or a root can leave the list).
 *
 * Behind both switches: trusted approvers (isTrustedApproversEnabled) and state-verified approvers
 * (isStateVerifiedApproversEnabled), each of which the SEDI/KERI umbrella turns off. Off, nothing is sent, nothing
 * arriving is read, and nothing is shown.
 *
 * What a verified card says, and no more: a State root on this phone's list names the card's holder as the guardian
 * of this phone's ward. It does not say the contact's phone controls that holder (that waits for the approver's own
 * KERI identity, stage 3), and the ward is a Developer setting, not yet bound to the person (KH-P3).
 *
 * Every record here is changed in place, never deleted.
 *
 * The check on open is memoised for this run of the app only (see {@link guardianStandings}): it runs again whenever
 * anything it reads has moved, and never across a restart or an OTA, so a verdict from older verifier code is never
 * reused.
