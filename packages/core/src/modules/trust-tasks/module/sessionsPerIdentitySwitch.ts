/**
 * Whether a rooms ask for a community goes out on that community's identity's own session (sessions phase B,
 * rooms-slow §8b, `vtiAgent.askAs`) instead of switching the shared session to it. Two values a release (an OTA
 * included) sets, and nothing else:
 *
 * - `on`: the release's choice. Off until the mini A/B (rooms-slow §8e) has measured it against today's path.
 * - `remoteOff`: the release's kill. Set it to `true` and every ask goes the shared way at the next start, whatever
 *   `on` says, until a release sets it back.
 *
 * Nothing is saved on the phone and nothing a person does changes either value, so a later release can always take it
 * back (`loadSwitch`'s one-way trap, 11-07). It is read on every ask.
 *
 * It fails closed to today's path: anything but `on` true and `remoteOff` false reads as off.
 *
 * Tests flip the entries and must put them back.
