/**
 * sharedConnectCeremony — the document-level pieces of the shared-connect
 * sequence that need no connection (plan WP7): the challenge-shaped
 * `propose.id`, the `ceremony` member every step carries, and the proof.
 *
 * Six documents travel (the plan's table): 1 `propose` (scanner), 2
 * `propose#response` (inviter), 3 `issue` (inviter), 4 `issue#response`
 * receipt (scanner), 5 `issue` (scanner), 6 `issue#response` receipt (inviter).
 * All carry `threadId` equal to the `propose` id and a `ceremony` member whose
 * `enactment` is the link's `_id`; all are signed. `issuer` and `recipient`
 * are the encounter VIDs, in band.
 *
 * Pure apart from {@link signSharedConnectDocument}, which asks the agent's
 * KMS for the signature. No `definitionDigest` is sent until the definition is
 * published (plan D7).
