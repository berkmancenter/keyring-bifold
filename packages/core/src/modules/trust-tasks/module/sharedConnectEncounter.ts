 * sharedConnectEncounter — the scanner's side of one shared-connect encounter:

 *
 * A new DID per encounter keeps two people who scanned different codes from
 * being linked by one identifier. It carries the services the chosen carriage
 * needs: `DIDCommMessaging` (as `createVtiClientDid` mints) and, for TSP, a
 * `TSPTransport` service naming the same mediator. Both name the mediator by
 * its DID, which is the form the VTA and Keyring read (companion §2.1); no
 * single `TSP` spelling is read by every stack, so the spelling is the one
 * constant {@link ENCOUNTER_TSP_SERVICE_TYPE}.
 *
 * The relay session itself (`VtiMediatorSession` as this DID) is opened by the
 * carriage (WP5), not here.
