/**
 * What a community sends a persona, collected wherever the person is in the app.
 *
 * A vetter grant, a membership, an invitation's issue, a community's
 * invitation offer — each arrives as a
 * message to the persona's DID, and the mediator holds it until a session for
 * that DID collects it. Until 2026-09-22 only the Vetting screen and a join
 * in flight opened that session, so a grant issued while the person was
 * elsewhere sat at the mediator: the seat stayed "being vetted" until they
 * happened to open Vetting (measured: the community's outbox sent it, and the
 * phone showed nothing until Vetting was opened once).
 *
 * `startPersonaInbox` keeps the persona's session open from unlock and stores
 * what arrives, the same way Vetting does. It never takes the session from
 * anything else: `vtiAgent` holds one session, so when some flow has opened it
 * (a join, Vetting, a community connect) the inbox only listens, and it
 * reconnects as the persona only when nothing is open.
