/**
 * VtaClient — the phone as the manager of a personal VTA.
 *
 * Under §2.4 B of `community_vetting_subtask.md` every Keyring user has a VTA
 * of their own, and Keyring is its manager the way upstream's terminal client
 * and browser plugin are: it enrols once, then asks the agent to mint personas,
 * releases their keys for the moments the phone must act as one, and answers
 * the agent's questions. This is that surface, over the same DIDComm v2
 * transport the community leg uses (`VtiMediatorTransport`): a VTA advertises
 * the same kind of mediator a VTC does.
 *
 * What the wire looks like, measured against `vta-service` 0.28 at
 * `53a7cde4`: a Trust Task to a VTA travels as a DIDComm message of the
 * framework's **binding envelope type** whose body IS the Trust Task document
 * (`vta-service/src/messaging/handlers.rs`, `handle_trust_task`), and the
 * authcrypt sender is the authenticated caller — its ACL entry decides what it
 * may ask. The reply is a framework result or error document in a message of
 * the same envelope type.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `vtiAgent` (the phone ↔ community leg): the two
 * present different identities — the manager identity here, a persona there —
 * and either can exist without the other.
 *
 * @module trust-tasks/module/VtaClient
