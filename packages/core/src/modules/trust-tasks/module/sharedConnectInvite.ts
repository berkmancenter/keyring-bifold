/**
 * sharedConnectInvite — Keyring as the INVITER of a shared-connect code (relationship-over-tsp plan WP9, §2.8).
 *
 * The phone mints a fresh `did:peer:2` for one code, logs in to the inviter relay as that DID, and shows
 *
 *   https://link.trustoverip.org/t#_from=<that DID>&_id=<16 random bytes>&_exp=<≤ 10 min>&_type=/vti/flow/shared-connect/0.1
 *
 * A scanner then forms a TSP relationship (`XRFI`, answered here with `XRFA`) and proposes. Everything that arrives
 * for the code goes through ONE choke point, {@link SharedConnectInviter.admit}: frames are taken one at a time, in
 * order, and each is opened, checked and either acted on or dropped. A drop is silent: no error document, no
 * accept, no nack and no distinct teardown; the TSP binding (§6) owes an unsolicited sender no reply path.
 *
 * The standing rule for a `propose` (§2.8, {@link proposeStanding}): its recipient is this code's live encounter
 * VID, its enactment is the code's `_id`, the code has not expired, its proof verifies under its issuer, its sender
 * formed a relationship with this code first, and nothing has been accepted on the code before. Every condition is
 * evaluated, after the same work (open, proof check), whatever the outcome: a failing code is not answered faster or
 * differently from a valid but spent one, because neither is answered at all.
 *
 * The bound (§2.8's spam guard, decided 2026-11-07): relationship invites are answered for
 * at most {@link SHARED_CONNECT_INVITE_MAX_INVITES} distinct scanners and one propose is accepted. Both live in the
 * persisted record, so they hold for as long as the code does. A scanner re-sending uses no slot: its invite is
 * answered again, and the same propose (same sender, same id) is the same acceptance.
 *
 * Teardown ({@link SharedConnectInviter.end}) is idempotent: expiry, cancel and completion all converge on it, the
 * first to arrive names the ending, and afterwards nothing survives: no timer, no listener, no relay session, and a
 * record written once more with a final state. This object is the record's only writer, and its writes are serial.
 *
 * Accepted proposals and the documents after them go to an attached {@link InviterCeremony} (the inverse ceremony,
 * a separate change); without one, an accepted propose leaves the code `proposed`.
 *
 * Nothing here logs the link, a label or any counterparty text: DID prefixes and outcome codes only (WP12).
