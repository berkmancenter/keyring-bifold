/**
 * Approving for someone else's agent (trusted-approver plan §9, T2): this phone said yes to being a person's approver
 * (approverRole.ts), and that person's agent now asks it about a task.
 *
 * The request reaches this phone on its own session (the asking phone forwards its agent's signed consent requests to
 * the approvers they name, `VtaClient.relayConsentRequests`), but it is from another agent. It is shown only when:
 * the trusted-approvers switch is on; its issuer is an agent this phone agreed to approve for; and it passes the same
 * check a request from this phone's own agent passes (`checkConsentRequest`), against that issuer.
 *
 * The decision goes to the asking agent, not to this phone's own: a `task-consent/decision` signed for
 * `assertionMethod` by this phone's manager DID (the DID in that agent's approver set), sealed by the same DID (the
 * session's identity) and forwarded by DID through the mediator. A reply counts only when it is threaded to the
 * decision and comes from that agent; a version the agent does not serve steps down, as with this phone's own agent.
