/**
 * A phone takes on its agent's community identities, when the person asks
 * ("Bring back your communities and cards from your agent"; Alberto, 10-13,
 * for 242). Never on its own at link: the phone shows communities it did not
 * join itself only once the person has asked for them.
 *
 * A phone keeps an identity per community (`VtiPersona`). Identities it did
 * not make itself (a new install, or one made with pnm/openvtc on the same
 * agent: IN-363, IN-114) it had nothing to restore cards for, so the cards the
 * agent keeps stayed there. The agent knows its DIDs (`dids/list`, every
 * context this phone's grant covers, nested ones included), and its vault
 * keeps the cards each community issued to one of them. A card about one of
 * the agent's own DIDs names the community it is for (its issuer), so the
 * identity is recorded from the two, and nothing else is guessed.
 *
 * The key ids come from the identity's DID document: `dids/list` answers the
 * DID record, which carries none, and the agent keeps an identity's keys under
 * the verification-method ids its published document names (vta-keys
 * `save_entity_key_records_with_ids`). A DID whose document cannot be read is
 * skipped and reported, never guessed at.
