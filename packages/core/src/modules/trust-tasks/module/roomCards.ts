/**
 * Which of an agent's cards a data room issued, so Bring back does not take a room for a community.
 *
 * Accepting a room offer stores two cards in the member's agent, both issued by the room's own DID
 * (`vtc/rooms/offers/accept`, stored with `vault/credentials/receive`): a `MembershipCredential` and an
 * `AuthorityCredential` for the actions the member holds in the room. The membership card carries exactly the
 * types a community's does (`VerifiableCredential`, `DTGCredential`, `MembershipCredential`), signed, in its
 * window and with no status list, so it passes the delivered-card check, and `classifyCredential` reads it as a
 * community membership with the room as the community. Bring back then kept a membership, and took on an
 * identity, for a "community" that is a room.
 *
 * The authority card tells the two apart. A room scopes it to its own DID and grants room actions
 * (`read`, `write`, `curate`, `admin`: data-rooms, `authority.actions`). A community's own authority card is
 * also scoped to its own DID, but grants roles (`role:member`, `role:vetter`) and carries `maxAttenuation`. An
 * issuer is a room when it gave the agent an authority card scoped to itself whose actions are all room actions;
 * every card that issuer gave is a room's card.
 *
