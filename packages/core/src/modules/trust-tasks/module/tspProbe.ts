/**
 * The TSP 1.0 probe: how a phone learns that an upstream service (a VTA or a
 * community) answers TSP 1.0 when its DID document does not say which TSP
 * version it speaks. TSP 1.0 cutover plan §6.2, row 4, with the changes made
 * on its approval (2026-10-23).
 *
 * - **What.** One `XRFI` invite and one read-only task, both in TSP 1.0. The
 *   leg supplies the sending and the waiting; this module owns when a probe may
 *   run, what its outcome is called, what is kept, and what is said.
 * - **Never in a person's way.** The session's real asks go over DIDComm from
 *   the first one; a probe runs beside them, and only its answer moves later
 *   asks to TSP 1.0.
 * - **At most one per peer per hour**, whatever the last outcome. A record is
 *   written before anything is sent, so a phone reconnecting every few minutes
 *   on a poor link cannot probe at each reconnect.
 * - **Down is not wrong.** A silent probe is "unanswered" (24 h before the next
 *   probe) only if the peer answered something else in the same session;
 *   otherwise the peer may simply be down, and the outcome is "inconclusive"
 *   (the hourly cap only).
