 * It uses the same approvals row as "Ask me before…" (approvalRules.ts), with a
 * second kind of rule: consent for a task, from one shared set of the people
 * this person trusts, one approval, and never the requester's own. Unlike "Ask
 * me before…", these rules are meant to hold tasks this phone sends (joining a
 * community borrows a key, `keys/export-secret`): the phone waits for the
 * approver's yes, which is the point. The approver needs no account on the
 * agent; membership in the set is enough (VTI docs/02-vta/task-consent.md,
 * "Membership in the approver set the policy names is sufficient").
 *
 * Every other rule and set in the row is kept exactly as it is.
