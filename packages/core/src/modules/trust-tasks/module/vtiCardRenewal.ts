/**
 * Renewing a member's community cards before they lapse (IN-501).
 *
 * A community issues the membership card and the role card for 30 days, a
 * length fixed in its code (VTI vtc-service credentials/mod.rs, vac.rs), and
 * renews them only when the member asks: `vtc/members/renew/0.1`, a signed
 * document from the member, no payload (vtc-service routes/members/renew.rs).
 * Inside the community the ACL decides membership, not the card, so a lapsed
 * card blocks nothing there; it can no longer be shown outside, and the phone
 * said "Your membership ended". Before this module Keyring never asked.
 *
 * - When: once two thirds of the card's life have passed (day 20 of 30), and
 *   for a card that has already lapsed, as soon as the phone is unlocked. The
 *   community renews whatever the card's dates say (renew.rs: "no expiry
 *   check, no grace window").
 * - How: as the membership's own identity, over the shared session, in a
 *   background hold (`vtiAgent.holding`): it gives way to anything the person
 *   is doing, and is tried again later.
 * - What comes back: a new membership card and role card. Each is checked as a
 *   delivered card is (`checkDeliveredCard`) and kept on the membership in
 *   place of the old one; "Member since" stays the day the membership began.
 *   The cards are then kept by the agent (the vault picks up new cards on
 *   `VTI_PERSONA_DELIVERIES_EVENT`), and the member's acknowledgement is issued
 *   again (`reciprocateIfOwed`): the old one binds to the old card's digest.
 * - Refusals (a personhood policy that no longer admits the member, or
 *   `renew:notMember`, the community holding no membership for this identity):
 *   the card is kept as it is and asked again later. Nothing here records a
 *   membership as ended; that stays with the community's removal notice.
 *   - no answer, a session another step holds, or a card that cannot be
 *     checked now: nothing changes, and it is asked again later.
 *
 * Nothing here ever deletes or replaces a card except with a renewed one that
 * passed its check.
